### Disscussion

- Had a disscussion with [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx) about the issue regarding the speed of
[scancode](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit) agent in fossology.
- Needed to understand [this commit](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/commit/8afa686fb71b9540029234e5a40c0572c4457c28)
and try to make a python script such that it can be used to make scancode agent in fossology works faster.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Will work on scancode integration task.
