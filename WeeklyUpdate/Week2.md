### Updates

- Implemented [SGDClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html)
  on the dataset and got the accuracy of **55 percent**.

  Total files scanned = 100,
  Successfully matched = 55

             ---> Total time elapsed: 6.29 Seconds  <---
             ---> Accuracy: 55.0%                     <---
             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Also the accuracy of previously implemented [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) is increased to **63 percent**.

  Total files scanned = 100,
  Successfully matched = 63

             ++++++++++++++++++ Result ++++++++++++++++++
             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
             ---> Total time elapsed: 4.19 Seconds  <---

             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Raised one **PR** on [Minerva](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation)
  to add the tested model of Logistic Regression.
  - [Add logistic regression model](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/pull/4)

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Will implement sklearn's Linear support vector machine on the
  [dataset](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation).
- And will raise prs for the implemented model and their agents on both
  [Minerva](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation) and
  [Atarashi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi) repository in upcoming days.
