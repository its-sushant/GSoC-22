### Updates

- This week I was wrapping up my all contributions till mid-term evaluation.

- Major Pull Requests:

  - [Add agent for Logistic Regression model on atarashi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi/pull/100)

    - This pull requested was created for the Logistic Regression agent that I have implemented
      on [atarashi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi). Currently the agent is giving the accuracy of
      **63** percent.

  - [Add agent for Linear Support vector machine](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi/pull/102)

    - This agent is also giving the accuracy of **63** percent. And the pull request for the same has
      been created on [atarashi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi).

  - [Add Okapibm25 agent](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi/pull/101)

    - The agent for Okapibm25 is the very basic implementation. I have used
      [Rank_bm25](https://pypi.org/project/rank-bm25/) package for
      transformation and the accuracy score is **62** percent.

  - [Add model packages](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/pull/5)

    - This pull request was created for the package that I have created for trained models. The
      package can be used in atarashi agent for predicting the license short name from source code.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Will start working further and train some deep learning model on
  [minerva dataset](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation)
