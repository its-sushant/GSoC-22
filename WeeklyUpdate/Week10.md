### Updates

- Started working on transformer for implementation on [minerva dataset](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation)
- Removed few errors and warnings that I was getting on previously trained models.
- Made few changes on my final report of the gsoc 2022 project and sync it with the progress of
my project.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Will keep working on some optional part of my project and also keep the [gsoc](https://github.com/fossology/gsoc) page updated.
